===============

Board Composition
-----------------
The SWC format governing board has five members: 

| **1. NeuroMorpho.Org representative**
| \ :sup:`A senior representative affiliated with and appointed by NeuroMorpho.Org with expertise in neuroinformatics as well as microanatomy of neurons and glial cells. The representative communicates NeuroMorpho.Org's ideas for development to the board, but also conveys decisions to the NeuroMorpho.Org development team to implement changes in the format to currently published and future reconstructions.`\
| **2. Allen Institute representative**
| \ :sup:`A senior representative affiliated with and appointed by the Allen Institute, that has expertise in neuroinformatics as well as microanatomy of neurons and glial cells. The representative communicates the ideas of the Allen Institute for development to the board, but also conveys decisions to concerned stakeholders within the Allen Institute.`\
| **3. Microanatomy expert**
| \ :sup:`An expert in neuroscience and microanatomy with long-time experience and insight in the workflow of creating digital reconstructions. Appointed by election.`\
| **4. Computational modeling expert**
| \ :sup:`An expert in computational neuroscience outside of NeuroMorpho.Org and Allen Institute with long-time experience in computational modeling of neurons using the SWC format. Appointed by election.`\
| **5. INCF advisor**
| \ :sup:`An advisor affiliated with and appointed by INCF that can provide an international perspective and broad community feedback to the development of the format.`\

Until the first election has taken place, the governing board will consist of Giorgio A. Ascoli, Bengt Ljungquist, Sumit Nanda, and Lydia Ng, serving as interrim stewards. Appointment of fifth member by INCF pending.

The :doc:`SWC specification Governing Board </governance>` consists of five members, each representing different stakeholders and serving a term of two years at a time. Elections for the two electable positions, microanatomy expert and computational modeling expert, will be announced to the NeuroMorpho.Org mailing list and Twitter feed as well as by the Allen Institute and INCF in their communication channels relevant to the position that is up for election. Each year, an election is held to replace the electable board member who has completed their two-year term or to fill a position that has become vacant. The election is confidential and is handled by the board, and the process is as defined below. The other three members will be appointed by the respective organizations at their discretion.
